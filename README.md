 Once upon a time, there was a student who went to a math lecture.  
When the lecture was over, he approached one of the other students, and said, "I couldn't follow that at all.  The professor was talking about rotating 8-dimensional objects!  How am I supposed to visualize something rotating in 8 dimensions?"

    "Easy," replied the other student, "you visualize it rotating in N dimensions, then let N go to 8."
