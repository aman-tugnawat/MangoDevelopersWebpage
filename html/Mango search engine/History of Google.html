		<h3>Beginning</h3>
		
		<p>Google began in 1995 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both Ph.D. students at Stanford University.[2]</p>

		<p>In search of a dissertation theme, Page had been 
considering—among other things—exploring the mathematical properties
 of the World Wide Web, understanding its link structure as a huge 
graph.[3] His supervisor, Terry Winograd, encouraged him to pick this 
idea (which Page later recalled as "the best advice I ever got"[4]) and 
Page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages link to a 
given page, based on the consideration that the number and nature of 
such backlinks was valuable information about that page (with the role 
of citations in academic publishing in mind).[3]</p>

		<p>In his research project, nicknamed "BackRub", Page was soon joined 
by Brin, who was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate 
Fellowship.[5] Brin was already a close friend, whom Page had first met 
in the summer of 1995, when Page was part of a group of potential new 
students that Brin had volunteered to show around the campus.[3] Both 
Brin and Page were working on the Stanford Digital Library Project 
(SDLP). The SDLP's goal was “to develop the enabling technologies for a
 single, integrated and universal digital library" and it was funded 
through the National Science Foundation, among other federal 
agencies.[5][6][7][8]</p>

		<p>Page's web crawler began exploring the web in March 1996, with 
Page's own Stanford home page serving as the only starting point.[3] To 
convert the backlink data that it gathered for a given web page into a 
measure of importance, Brin and Page developed the PageRank 
algorithm.[3] While analyzing BackRub's output—which, for a given URL,
 consisted of a list of backlinks ranked by importance—the pair 
realized that a search engine based on PageRank would produce better 
results than existing techniques (existing search engines at the time 
essentially ranked results according to how many times the search term 
appeared on a page).[3][9]</p>

		<p>Convinced that the pages with the most links to them from other 
highly relevant Web pages must be the most relevant pages associated 
with the search, Page and Brin tested their thesis as part of their 
studies, and laid the foundation for their search engine.:[10]</p><p>


		</p><h3>Late 1990s</h3>

		<p>Originally the search engine used Stanford's website with the 
domain google.stanford.edu. The domain google.com was registered on 
September 15, 1997. They formally incorporated their company, Google, on
 September 4, 1998 in their friend Susan Wojcicki's garage in Menlo 
Park, California.</p>

		<p>Both Brin and Page had been against using advertising pop-ups in a 
search engine, or an "advertising funded search engines" model, and they
 wrote a research paper in 1998 on the topic while still students. They 
changed their minds early on and allowed simple text ads.[12]</p>

		<p>By the end of 1998, Google had an index of about 60 million 
pages.[13] The home page was still marked "BETA", but an article in 
Salon.com already argued that Google's search results were better than 
those of competitors like Hotbot or Excite.com, and praised it for being
 more technologically innovative than the overloaded portal sites (like 
Yahoo!, Excite.com, Lycos, Netscape's Netcenter, AOL.com, Go.com and 
MSN.com) which at that time, during the growing dot-com bubble, were 
seen as "the future of the Web", especially by stock market 
investors.[13]</p>

		<p>In March 1999, the company moved into offices at 165 University 
Avenue in Palo Alto, home to several other noted Silicon Valley 
technology startups.[14] After quickly outgrowing two other sites, the 
company leased a complex of buildings in Mountain View at 1600 
Amphitheatre Parkway from Silicon Graphics (SGI) in 2003.[15] The 
company has remained at this location ever since, and the complex has 
since become known as the Googleplex (a play on the word googolplex, a 
number that is equal to 1 followed by a googol of zeros). In 2006, 
Google bought the property from SGI for US$319 million.[16]</p>

		<h3>2000s</h3>

		<p>The Google search engine attracted a loyal following among the 
growing number of Internet users, who liked its simple design.[17] In 
2000, Google began selling advertisements associated with search 
keywords.[2] The ads were text-based to maintain an uncluttered page 
design and to maximize page loading speed.[2] Keywords were sold based 
on a combination of price bid and click-throughs, with bidding starting 
at $.05 per click.[2] This model of selling keyword advertising was 
pioneered by Goto.com (later renamed Overture Services, before being 
acquired by Yahoo! and rebranded as Yahoo! Search 
Marketing).[18][19][20] While many of its dot-com rivals failed in the 
new Internet marketplace, Google quietly rose in stature while 
generating revenue.[2]</p>

		<p>Google's declared code of conduct is "Don't be evil", a phrase 
which they went so far as to include in their prospectus (aka "S-1") for
 their 2004 IPO, noting that "We believe strongly that in the long term,
 we will be better served—as shareholders and in all other ways—by a
 company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short
 term gains."[21] In 2008, Google launched Knol, their own equivalent of
 Wikipedia,[22] which failed just four years later.[23]</p>

		<h3>2010s</h3>
	
		<p>In 2011, the company launched Google+, its fourth foray into social
 networking, following Google Buzz (launched 2010, retired in 2011), 
Google Friend Connect (launched 2008, retired by March 1, 2012), and 
Orkut (launched in 2004, retired in September 2014[24])</p>

		<p>As of November 2014, Google operated over 70 offices in more than 41 countries.[25]</p>

		<p>In 2015, Google reorganized its interests as a holding company, 
Alphabet Inc., with Google as its leading subsidiary. Google continued 
to serve as the umbrella for Alphabet's Internet interests.[26][27][28]</p>
